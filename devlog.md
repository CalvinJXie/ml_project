# ml_project

04/10/2025 - created project in github.

4/11/2025 - create file for linear regression, SVM, random forest, LSTM, and gradient boost. 

4/12/2025 - udpdate code for functioning linear regression, SVM, random forest, with issue at LSTM and gradient boost.

4/21/2025 - modify gradient boost to remove the flatlining issue when making prediction; LSTM model is now functionable.

4/23/2025 - LSTM, linear regression, Gradient boost with new classification for better accuracy

4/24/2025 - LSTM, Linear regression, Gradient boost all tested with new data that is not trained.
